# ðŸ§¬ EpiNN_data

Training data and annotations for the EpiNN model described in Stricker et al. "Genome-wide classification of epigenetic activity reveals regions of enriched heritability in immune-related traits". The `training_data` folder contains code and scripts to train the EpiNN model. The `annotations` folder contains EpiNN annotations used in the manuscript. The `bed` subfolder contains a raw EpiNN annotation in bed format and an annotation that has been thresholded by setting all values <0.75 to 0. The `ldsc` subfolder contains annotations used to perform Stratified LD-Score Regression (S-LDSC) analyses.
